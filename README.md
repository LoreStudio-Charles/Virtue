# Virtue
Virtue is a game of heroic adventure, sacrifice, and loss.
To win, sometimes you must lose it all.

```
Stare into a mirror, what do you see? 
    Are you the man that you would wish you could be?
Others around you stare back and see, 
   only an image you've shown them to be.
Above it all and high on His throne, looks down loving father. 
   You are never alone.
```

## Virtues
Virtues are shown in the UI with animated icons that give a vague feeling of the character feels about the self or if examining someone else how they feel about the character. Only when the game ends is one's True virtue revealed.

We never see the numerical scores which range from -100 to 100.

### Charity
Pure love toward others is the virtue of charity. It can be expressed through giving, sacrifice, or sharing with others. Sometimes an action as simple as listening to another's troubles can demonstrate charity.
### Faith
Trust in God and in His promises as made through Christ and the Scriptures by which humans are justified or saved.
### Humility
The quality or condition of being humble; modest opinion or estimate of one's own importance, rank, etc. This virtue may be the most likely to deviate from True to Personal, as when one most thinks they are being humble is often when they are being the least humble.
### Justice
Rightfulness or lawfulness in an active state of defense against the schemes of evil doers. Often a virtue accompanied by violence of action.
### Perseverence
Continuance in a state of grace to the end, leading to eternal salvation.
### Temperance
Pureness and moderation in the indulgences of one's natural appetites or passions. Frequently related to abstinence from wanton lusts, gluttony, or drunkenness.
### Valor
Boldness or determination in facing great danger, especially in battle; heroic courage; bravery: Often associated with violence of action, but valor can also be tied to stillness in the face of danger. Standing patiently when everything within your soul screams that you should fight or run away.
### Worldwide (True Virtue)
Worldwide or true virtue is known only by the omniscient creator Loving Father. Not even the character would know these values for certain, but this is a measure of how the character's actions have shaped the world around themselves.
### Audience (Percieved Virtue)
Audience or percieved virtue is a character in the eyes of some other non-player character. This will affect how each individual within the world relates to the character and how they might treat or mistreat them.
### Personal (Internal Virtue)
Person or internal virtue is the virtue how the character views himself. Are they ashamed of their past? Proud of what they have done? Do they believe that they are inherently good? Are they really?

## Encounters
Virtues are tested by **encounters**. An encounter may seem trivial to the player, but even the most mundane encounter is a vital moment during which a character's virtues are exposed to the world around them. A player may see an encounter may be life or death, but in truth an encounter may be even more important. Even the most minor encounters may shape the character's ultimate fate.

During an encounter a character may face obstacles. Obstacles are the tests, trials, and tribulations which expose them to risk of loss and test their virtues. These often force players into situations where they must choose between their virtues or making a sacrifice or loss. 
### Obstacles
Obstacles represent the moment of hardship when a character must overcome some difficulty or face an especially difficult loss. Obstacles come in three varieties, Tests, Trials, and Tribulations. These are described below.

#### Tests
A test is something that a character must overcome to progress the story.

Tests most often require a character to use their skills to overcome some situation and are the kind of encounter testing that is least likely to negatively impact a characters virtue. Often the only implications of a test are to the character's Personal Virtues, although this is not always the case.

#### Trials
A trial is an event which will force a character to use a skill skill and also risk their virtues. 

Often trials require great sacrifice combined with skillful play in order to achieve the best results. 

There will often be shortcuts to make a Trial easier, but shortcuts may imperil the those around the character. They seem like the easy path, but may cause the greatest risk to harm of the character. The danger is that often a character may fail the test of some crucial virtue, and yet believe they have succeeded.
#### Tribulations
Tribulations are events which are meant to humble a character and present inevitable loss. You will suffer during a tribulation. 

Tribulations often ravage the character's Personal Virtues, but just as often the greatest opportunites to raise World and Audience virtues.

```
Ex: 

I have failed. I lost everything. Says the man who was robbed on the way to purchase goods.

No my son, you just don't see that your sacrfice has saved us all. 

The goods have been returned by authorities. 

I would only have lost my son if you had tried to stop them.
```

Beneath the tales of strength and cheer,
he longs to conquer lonely fear.

In shadow cast by brothers' lives,
he prays and hopes, as he still strives

the sagas told in his brother's names.

For every seed of doubt, he sows,
A quiet courage within him grows.
His overshadowed spirits rise,
and dreams, beneath the azure skies.

#### Justice, Humility, or Perseverance
One chilly morning, as a light mist blankets the ground, you wander through a park near the village of Swansea, clutching your favorite red ball. The air is crisp, and your excitement bubbles over as you bounce the ball, imagining all the fun games you could play with your friends. Suddenly, your joyful exploration stops when you spot a small group of children gathered near the pond.  
Curious, you edge closer and see a younger girl, Lily, sitting alone on a swing with tears streaming down her cheeks. A violin lies haphazardly discarded in the mud nearby. Older children are mocking her for not knowing how to play the instrument. You feel a tug at your heart; you know how it feels for someone to make fun of you. Seeing someone else endure such pain stings.  
##### Option Cards
YMarch up to those bullies in a display of **Justice** and tell them to stop. It would take great courage and might mean facing their anger, but standing up for what is right is something that you believe in.  
Approach Lily gently, sit with her, and offer her words of comfort. In an act of **Humility**, you could share your own experiences of feeling left out, showing her that she's not alone. This choice might not stop the bullying immediately, but it would lift her spirits and affirm her worth.  
Teach Lily the value of **Perseverance** through our sufferings and remind her that everyone starts somewhere. You could invite her to play with you, showing her that persistence can lead to improvement and new friendships.

#### Charity, Faith, or Valor
As you stroll along the narrow path leading from your family's small farm into the village of Swansea, the sun hangs low in the sky, casting golden rays across the fields. You're lost in thought about the day's chores when you hear a commotion near the marketplace. Curiosity piqued, you quicken your steps.  
When you arrive, you see a crowd gathered around a wooden cart that has toppled over. A merchant's wares are strewn across the ground. A vibrant array of fruits, fabrics, and trinkets. Among the crowd, you spot a figure struggling to gather the spilled goods: an elderly woman, her frail hands shaking as she tries to lift a crate filled with fragile pottery.  
Some villagers laugh, pointing at the woman's misfortune instead of helping her. A pang of discomfort twists in your stomach. Memories of your family's struggles resurface, reminding you of the kindness shown in your times of need.  
##### Option Cards
Rush forward, in an act of **Charity**, and offer to help the woman gather her things. You could encourage others to join in, spreading goodwill in the face of mockery. It feels right to lend a hand, regardless of the scornful looks from the crowd.  
Approach the woman calmly, in an act of **Faith**, and reassure her that everything will be alright. You could remind her of Loving Father's provision and how he has carried her through hardships before, encouraging her to believe in His love and not let this misfortune define her.  
Step up to confront them with **Valor**, telling them to stop their laughter and instead lend their strength to help the woman. It would take courage to stand against the mockery, but igniting a sense of unity within the crowd may instigate a change in the atmosphere.

With your heart racing, you take a deep breath and prepare to make your choice, each path guiding you toward a different kind of heroism. What happens next is up to you.  

#### Charity, Humility, Perseverance
The late afternoon sun bathes the fields in a golden hue as you wander along the familiar path leading home from the village market. Your heart is light, buoyed by the prospect of sharing your day's stories with your siblings. But as you approach the edge of the woods, the laughter and chatter of children catch your ear. Intrigued, you make your way toward the sound.  
You soon discover a gathering of village kids playing near the brook, but the mood shifts when you notice a girl at the edge of the group, her arms crossed tightly and tears glistening on her cheeks. It is Elara, a timid neighbor who often keeps to herself. She clutches a small, ragged doll that has seen better days. A couple of older boys are mocking her, taunting her about her old toy, and urging the others to join in the laughter.  
A pang of sympathy strikes you. You remember childhood when you felt isolated among your siblings' boisterous games. You have endured mockery; you understand the weight of such teasing.  
##### Option Cards
Reach out to Elara, offering to share your beloved possessions or even a more suitable toy from your home, proving that **Charity** can triumph over cruelty.  
Approach Elara with understanding and share stories of times you felt overlooked or mocked. Standing beside her, you could encourage her to talk about her feelings while letting her know it's perfectly okay to feel upset. In this act of **Faith**, you could remind her that even the Returning Prince faced scorn and Betrayal.  
Suggest a game that could include everyone, encouraging the boys to redirect their energy into something positive. Showing **Temperance**, you could guide the group in a playful contest, showing them there's more joy in camaraderie than in ridicule. This way, you teach Elara and the others about kindness through shared experiences.

### Outlaw 
In forest deep, stands hunter tall,  
With strength of heart, a promise calls.  
His bowstring sings. An arrow flies;  
the missile strays and clears the skies.  


Beyond the stag, a messenger falls,   
the guilt of blood, for justice calls.  
it stains my hands, I bear this cost,  
A heart so bold, now deeply lost.   


On the run, I flee my name,  
rumors spread, as does my shame.  
Oh, how I wish I could recall
That missile's flight, its deadly fall.  


My mother's love, a beacon bright,  
Guides me home through dark of night.  
I yearn to clear this bloody stain,  
hold momma close, and ease her pain.  


Alone, I work to clear my name  
and find my way back home again.  
The truth will rise, it's imminent,  
And prove my soul is innocent.

#### Justice, Humility, or Faith
You stand at the edge of the farm, the air thick with the scent of earth and hay. Your siblings are scattered about, engrossed in their games. Laughter rings out like bells in the warm sunlight. But your attention is drawn to the small clearing where a sparrow flutters helplessly, caught in a snare you set in your innocent curiosity.  
As you approach, your stomach knots. You didn't mean to hurt the little creature. Its tiny eyes are full of fear, and you can feel its desperation. You remember your mother's stories about the importance of kindness and justice. But your father had warned against trying to set traps without his help.  
You glance back at your siblings, who are happily unaware of your turmoil. You could call for help or seek out one of them to loosen the rope, but that would mean admitting your mistake. The thought of their laughter turning to scorn crushes your heart.   
As you crouch beside the sparrow, its tiny chest rising and falling rapidly, you know you have a decision to make. Do you:  
##### Option Cards
Call your siblings to get help in an act of **Humility**, knowing that it might mean mockery from them.  
Recall the stories of the Loving Father's love for the sparrow, have **Faith** in His protection, and tell your siblings to get your father, knowing that this could lead to punishment.  
Unravel the snare, rush the sparrow home to your father, and confess what you did. Surrendering to **Justice** may be the fastest way to help the tiny creature.

#### Charity, Temperance, or Valor
You stand on the edge of the sun-drenched field, the tall grass whispering secrets as the wind sways through it. The sweet scent of wildflowers mingles with the earthy aroma of tilled soil. You and your siblings have been tasked with gathering the herbs from summer before the first frost blankets the ground. Laughter fills the air, a melodic backdrop to your diligent work.  
As you bend down to pluck a sprig of thyme, you hear a whimpering sound beneath the nearby oak. Curiosity pulls you closer, and you discover a small, trembling dog caught in the brambles. His matted fur is coated with dirt, and his eyes, wide with fear, plead for help. You reach out instinctively, but the thorns snag at your fingers, a painful warning of what might come if you intervene.  
Glancing back at your siblings shows them having fun, oblivious to the suffering creature. You can feel the weight of the decision pressing on your young shoulders. This little dog needs you, but aiding him means sacrificing precious time. Your family depends on gathering the herbs for winter supplies.  
You pause, feeling the world's weight settle on your young heart. Do you:  
##### Option Cards
Carefully cut through the brambles to free the dog, offering him the **Charity** he desperately needs, even if it costs you time.  
Hurry back to gather your siblings, rallying their strength to help the dog together, demonstrating the power of **Temperance** in your response as you work with your siblings to overcome the briars as a united front.  
Rush to the rescue and face the thorns alone, freeing the dog with determination and courage, embodying **Valor** in your choice to help, regardless of the risk to yourself.

In this moment, you stand at a crossroads, a child learning that every choice carries weight and that the path of the heart isn't always the easiest one to follow. What happens next is up to you.  

#### Justice, Faith, or Perseverance
The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a warm glow over the fields of Swansea as you stride across the familiar paths of your family's farm. The voices of your siblings fade into the distance as you approach the village, a sense of unease settling in your chest. There are whispers in town. Rumors of trouble brewing, tales of stolen crops, and harsh words exchanged between neighbors.  
As you reach the edge of the village, the commotion draws your attention. A crowd has gathered, anger and fear palpable in the air. You step closer, your heart pounding as you hear shouts accusing a struggling farmer, Edgar, of theft. He stands in the center, his face pale and trembling, hands raised in a plea for understanding. You know Edgar well; he has always been kind to your family, sharing what little he has when times are tough.   
"Enough!" a voice booms from somewhere in the crowd, a farmer from a neighboring plot whose resentment towards Edgar has festered for years. "He's been caught red-handed! It's time he faces justice for his misdeeds."  
You feel a surge of anger rising within you. You know Edgar wouldn't steal; you think desperation drives people to do things they usually wouldn't. Yet, the majority seems set on punishment and ready to act without hearing him out.  
As the voices grow louder, you realize you're at a crossroads. You could:  
##### Option Cards
Step forward and defend Edgar, demanding that **Justice** be served once the truth is established, even if it means putting yourself in the line of scorn from the villagers.  
Trust in the stories of **Faith** your mother shared. That Loving Father will provide for all. You restore the stolen crops, knowing that you risk personal loss unless you discover what happened to the crops.  
Choose **Perseverance**, calm the crowd, and seek out proof of Edgar's innocence quietly in the shadows. Find the culprit behind the theft while keeping Edgar safe from the fierce judgment of the villagers.

In this moment, you understand that the weight of your choice could change Edgar's fate and reshape the bonds within your community. What happens next is up to you.  


### Sailor
Upon the waves, I sail with pride,  
My family's love, I will abide.  
From distant lands, these goods I bring,  
Through stormy seas, their hearts still sing.  

Fate is cruel. It's rage resounds  
I washed into the Deepen Sounds  
My family fears that all is lost,  
Yet on this isle, I have been tossed.

With every breath, I must convey,  
I am alive; not swept away.  
Oh, whisper gently upon the breeze,  
let momma know I roam these seas.  

Though waters rise and tempest roars,  
In quiet moments, my spirit soars.  
I'll find my way back home in time,  
love knows no bounds, my hope's sublime.

#### Temperance, Humility, or Valor
You stand at the edge of the small farm, your tiny fingers brushing against the rough-hewn fence. The afternoon sun kisses the land, casting shadows of the tall grasses swaying in the breeze. Your sisters giggle nearby, weaving flower crowns, while the sounds of your brothers' playing fill the air. But your focus is drawn to something more pressing—a group of older boys from the village has gathered near the edge of the field, their shouts echoing like thunder across the serene landscape.
They torment a smaller boy, one not much older than you. His cheeks are stained with tears, and you can see the tremble in his small frame as they shove him back and forth. A mix of anger and fear wells within you. You want to rush forward, protect him, and show those boys that what they’re doing is wrong. But a firm voice in your mind reminds you of your mother’s lessons on patience and kindness.
You grip the fence tightly, weighing your options. Do you:
##### Option Cards
Leap into the fray—displaying Valor and courage against the bigger boys. Yet, you know that rushing in might only escalate the situation, putting yourself and the little boy in more danger. 
In Humility, find help from an adult to involve a village member who would be much more capable of handling this. But then, you fear that the small boy will feel even more alone during the wait.
Approach the group with Temperance and, in a calm voice, ask why they’re being so mean. In doing so, perhaps you could appeal to their better natures, reminding them that everyone deserves kindness.
##### Footer
As the echoes of their taunts ring loudly, you take a deep breath, feeling the weight of your decision pressing down like the warm sun overhead. What happens next is up to you.
#### Justice, Faith, or Charity 
The sun hangs low in the sky, casting a golden hue over the small farm as you watch your siblings playing near the old oak tree. Laughter fills the air, a sweet melody you cherish. But on the edge of the field, a commotion catches your attention—a group of village boys looms around a girl, their jeers sharp as the farm’s tools. You notice her, a familiar face from the village market, clutching her basket tightly; the contents spilled around her like shattered hopes.
Their taunts pierce through the gentle breeze as they mock her for dropping her goods, the flowers wilting in the dirt. You feel the heat rise in your cheeks, a mix of anger and the urge to protect her. You know you can’t just stand by. But how to intervene? 
In this moment, you must choose your path. Do you:
##### Option Cards
Shout at the boys, demanding they stop their cruelty, ready to defend the girl and uphold Justice. The chance of escalating the confrontation hangs heavy in the air, and so does the thrill of standing up for someone who cannot stand for herself.
Pray for courage, trusting that guidance will come from the Loving Father. Time is precious, but Faith in Father's timing is perfect.
Approach gently, offering to help her gather the fallen flowers, showing Charity is the purest form of strength. In doing so, you’d create a small act of goodness that might inspire others to rethink their actions. But would your kind act be enough to change their hearts?

With the scene before you becoming increasingly intense, you take a deep breath, feeling the weight of your decision just as you felt the ocean’s embrace during your last journey. What happens next is up to you.
#### Justice, Valor, or Perseverance
Shadows lengthen over the fields as you return from a day spent sailing to the neighboring island. The salty breeze clings to your skin and the sound of waves crashing against the shore lingers in your ears. You're eager to share your tales of adventure with your siblings, but as you approach the village square, a commotion draws your attention.
A group of village men has gathered, their voices rising in anger. At the center, you spot a familiar figure—Eli, the butcher's son, pinned against the side of the well. Three older boys tower over him, their jeering laughter ringing harshly against the cobblestones. You notice the fear etched on Eli's face, the desperation in his wide eyes. The sight of him being bullied ignites a fire within you, and you feel the weight of your choices pressing down like the sails of your ship on a stormy sea.
##### Option Cards
In an act of Valor, you could shout the bullies' names and demand they let Eli go, your heart pounding as you anticipate their response—a confrontation that could lead to trouble, but you can’t stand by and watch him suffer.
Rally the nearby villagers to bring Justice. You could call for help from the local blacksmith, known for his strength and fairness, knowing that sometimes it’s best to stand united against cruelty. But waiting for aid could prolong Eli's humiliation.
Instead of rushing into the fray or seeking help, you might decide to distract the bullies with a challenge and lure them away. An act of Perseverance might buy the time he needs if you can just run long enough to get away from them yourself.

### Lover
I rode to town, heart full of hope,  
and saw my love, my dream to cope.  
Yet shadows cast, with danger near,  
A man gave chase, and lit my fear.  

I charged like wind, fire in my veins,  
To save my love from deadly chains.  
She came to me, spark in her eyes,  
fate played its hand, we faced goodbyes.  

Her faltering step caused me despair,  
Her light grew dim, in evening air.  
One last gasp, our future sealed,  
left all alone, my hope repealed.

Yesterday, the world did glow,

My families goods I hoped to trade,

Three men of night stole more than dreams,  
Left me with rags and silent screams.  
But truth's a secret that I must keep,  
mama's smile would die, and pa would weep.  

My sorrow lives, cruelty remains,  
A burden yes, a weight of pains.  
For in the heart this ache will grow,  
a burden none must ever know.

A silent, stalking, whispering, friend  
A haunting tale that has to end.

In the mundane, hope may find room.

and strike a blaze of love to keep.

## Keys
Keys will open or close the door to new encounters.
A key might be as simple as timing. An encounter takes place for 1-10 hours. Miss it, and you missed out.
A key might be something from your past that has come back. You'll never see Justin become a soldier, if he never gets a sword. It's his only path into the service and you both know it.
Skills can be keys as well. If you can't swim or sail from the island, you can't see what's out in the ocean. If you don't have the perception to notice the handle, the door isn't even there. Can't read? The library is a mystery. Can't sing? Probably don't try changing the vibe at the public house.
Keys unlock doors and to walk through a door, you often need to find both.

### MVP Goal
Because Goodson and Ms. Mary Sue have the simplest intro, character creation will start with creating one of these two characters and beginning near the farm.
Exploring the nearby area and participating in the encounter Justin's Arming Sword.

## User Interface
### Virtues, Attributes, and Skills
These numbers will never be shown on the interface. Instead only an iconic representation or "weak reference" will serve as an indication of these values.

Virtues range from -100 to 100 with lower values representing less virtuous lifestyles and higher values representing more a virtuous past.
The values shown on the character sheet represent one's personal virtue, meaning these are the virtues as your character believes they stand. Note that even this score is not an accurate representation of the character's True virtue.
Values shown when a character examines an NPC in the world represent both how the character percieves that NPC (left icon) and how the NPC percieves the character (right icon).

Some ideas for representation of each virtue follow.
Neutral values (-25 to 25)  will be a grey man.

## A Few Encounter Ideas
### Justin's Arming Sword (key: Days 1-3)
Justin found an arming sword earlier this morning. He left it in the field, and went to find you and show you that he's going to be able to become a soldier. You both know he could never have afforded to purchase a sword like this and he wants to celebrate.

You find a sword in the field, or possibly on a goblin thief. Taking the sword for yourself you show it to Justin who looks on it with admiration. He can't admit he had found it first and you don't know.

Will you keep the weapon or give it to Justin? The only guide you may have is that it is his lifelong dream and that he could never afford such a blade.

Effects:
Determines if you or Justin become a soldier.
If Justin does he becomes a great hero and fulfills his life's dream. If you keep it, would you?

### Papas Bad Day (key: Animal Handling)
Something is wrong with Tully the bull. Papa tries to check on him. Tully panics and tramples papa. Can you calm the bull and save papa before its too late?

His life may depend on your quick action.

Effects:
Papa might live or die based on your actions. He's already injured and will spend time recovering either way.
You might be injured or killed yourself if you enter the pen, and Papa says no so you'll be in trouble if you don't listen... but Mama, mama would she ever forgive you if you didn't try to help?

### The Wrong Vial (key: Reading)
Farmer Perkins can't read but he's been sick lately. You notice as he's taking his medicine that the bottle reads Arsenic not Aresine. He doesn't know he might be killing himself.

Will you risk embarrassing the poor farmer in order to save a life?

Effects:
Farmer Perkins will die if he drinks the poison.
If you warn him, he'll be angry because he wasn't really going to drink it. Then he chases you off the farm for being such a mean child.
Mamma Perkins knows. She knows Farmer Perkins can't read and he's ashamed. She grows to love you. In time Farmer Perkins tells the story of how you bravely saved his life.

### Black Cat
A strange black cat keeps showing up on the farm. It's staring at you and wont leave. Something feels ominous about the creature, but you're not sure what to do.

Will you chase it away, follow it, or try and ignore it?

Effects:
It could be stalking you. It might be bringing something darker with it, or it may itself be a spy.
If you ignore it, then it may result in curses. If you harm it, they could be even worse.
Chasing it away may be the safest course of action. Reporting it to the constable could cause quite the investigation.

## Project Goals
### Imperfection
We don't want to strive for perfection.

We want beauty. Love. Honesty. Joy.

The game doesn't have to be perfect and nothing in the game has to be perfect. Make it beautiful, not sterile.

We want people to laugh and cry. Maybe even laugh at us at times. That's okay. We want to be honest.

Show the world we love them. That is the goal. Create something that tells someone somewhere, "God loves you."

Give someone hope.

Don't try to be perfect. Make a good story that inspires someone. Love, laugh, sing, smile.

### Special, Different, New
Don't chase topics that are worn old. Don't open old wounds.

The game should heal others.

It is not an action game. It is not a war game.

It is a series of stories that should touch the heart. Don't build Diablo. Battlefield. World of Warcraft.

Find the beauty inside Its a Wonderful Life, pluck it out and show George how valuable he really is. Don't let George kill himself. Show him the world without his actions.

### Jesus, Love, Mercy
Romans 12:19-21 KJV
[19] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. [20] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. [21] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

Psalm 99:5 KJV
[5] Exalt ye the LORD our God, And worship at his footstool; For he is holy.

Virtue should be impossible to win. Every action has the potential to crush each of the virtues, but few have a realistic expectation on increasing more than one.

Moment to moment gameplay, victory probably feels simple.
Looking back at what we have done it should feel hopelessly out of reach.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.

### Multiplayer? Coop?
Can we do it? Yes, of course.  
Should we? Maybe? I don't know.  
Would we like to? Yes, absolutely.  

Ideally this will be a 1-4 player experience with shared storytelling. Each player will experience their own version of the story and their own encounters. Any players present for an encounter will all participate in that encounter. If the players split up and two discover `The Black Mine` and two discover `The Ghost Ship`, then only the players present will recieve rewards, face the trials, and experience the cinematic events that take place in their encounters.

It would have to unfold in a way where every story impacts each other. The players won't begin near each other, so they will slowly unfold different storylines. Everyone must have their own virtue scores, so that might be tough.

Needs a dedicated server if we do this.

Decision is up in the air, but for MVP it would be a distraction so tabled for now.

## Assets
### Synty primarily
These are pretty, but also simple.
Characters will be set based on background. Who you choose at the start never changes much. Maybe held items or possibly equipped bags or something?

Icons will be simple SVG graphics. Most values will either be displayed at an Icon, Text, or combination. Not a lot of animation going on, beyond some glowing behind icons at extreme levels.

### So, are you the hero of the story?
Think for a moment of Saul.
He was winning. "I got you Stephen! Hah, noobs! We dit it!"
The encounters kept going his way. He looked great in the game. His stats were top notch.
"Hey Saul, new quest available. Here are orders, you've unlocked encounters across the region. Arrest them all."
On the cusp of victory Saul sets out for the capital. He is ready to win everything.
Charity: White heart blue background

Maybe he even thought as he set out for Demascus, "I'm such a good guy."

--- flashbang grenades

"Saul, Saul. Why are you persecuting me?"

Charity: Black, stoney heart wreathed in flames.

Saul thinks in horror, "Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
There is only one name who can deliver us from this body of death. 
Only one name can cleanse a coal black heart to pure white.
We need to point people toward the way.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.
