# Virtue
Virtue
A game of heroic adventure, sacrifice, and loss.
To win, sometimes you must lose it all.

```
Stare into a mirror, what do you see? 
    Are you the man you would wish to be?
Others around you stare back and see, 
   only an image you've shown them to be.
Above it all and high on His throne, looks down loving father. 
   You were never alone.
```

## Virtues
Virtues are shown in the UI with animated icons that give a vague feeling of the character feels about the self or if examining someone else how they feel about the character. Only when the game ends is one's True virtue revealed.

We never see the numerical scores which range from -100 to 100.

### Charity
Pure love toward others is the virtue of charity. It can be expressed through giving, sacrifice, or sharing with others. Sometimes an action as simple as listening to another's troubles can demonstrate charity.
### Faith
Trust in God and in His promises as made through Christ and the Scriptures by which humans are justified or saved.
### Humility
The quality or condition of being humble; modest opinion or estimate of one's own importance, rank, etc. This virtue may be the most likely to deviate from True to Personal, as when one most thinks they are being humble is often when they are being the least humble.
### Justice
Rightfulness or lawfulness, as of a claim or title; justness of ground or reason.
### Perseverence
Continuance in a state of grace to the end, leading to eternal salvation.
### Temperance
Pureness habitual moderation in the indulgence of a natural appetite or passion.
### Valor
Boldness or determination in facing great danger, especially in battle; heroic courage; bravery: 
### Worldwide (True Virtue)
Worldwide or true virtue is known only by the omniscient creator Loving Father. Not even the character would know these values for certain, but this is a measure of how the character's actions have shaped the world around themselves.
### Audience (Percieved Virtue)
Audience or percieved virtue is a character in the eyes of some other non-player character. This will affect how each individual within the world relates to the character and how they might treat or mistreat them.
### Personal (Internal Virtue)
Person or internal virtue is the virtue how the character views himself. Are they ashamed of their past? Proud of what they have done? Do they believe that they are inherently good? Are they really?

## Encounters
Virtues are tested by ENCOUNTERS. These may seem trivial to the player, but they are vital moments during which a character's virtues are exposed to the world around them. A player may see an encounter may be life or death, but in truth an encounter may be even more important. Even the most minor encounters may shape the character's ultimate fate.
During an encounter a character may face tests, trials, and tribulations which pit their ability to survive and thrive against their virtues. These often force players into situations where they must choose between their virtues or making a sacrifice or loss. 
### Tests
A test is something that a character must overcome to progress. Tests most often require a character to use their skills to overcome and are the kind of encounter testing that is least likely to negatively impact a characters virtue. Often the only implications of a test are to the character's Personal Virtues, although this is not always the case.
### Trials
A trial is an event which will both test a character's skills and their virtues. Often trials require great sacrifice combined with skillful play in order to achieve the best results. There will often be shortcuts to make a Trial easier, but these shortcuts will imperil the World, Audience and possibly even Personal Virtues. The danger is that these often do not impact personal virtue, and so failing a character may believe they have succeeded.
### Tribulations
Tribulations are events which are meant to humble a character and often have no perceptable winning outcome. They often ravage the character's Personal Virtues, but just as often the greatest opportunites to raise World and Audience virtues.
#### Attributes of an Encounter
#### Level
The expected level an encounter will take place. Often the level of an encounter is tied to the region in which it takes place, but this is not always the case.

## Backgrounds
### Goodson
The youngest of the farm boys, you've always lived under the shadow of your brothers. Momma loves you, and papa always smiles.
You try to do then proud, but feel small living in the shadows of your strong brothers adventures.
How can you ever compare?
Read, Sing, Perception, Tend Animals

### The Outlaw 
The song Hung my Head by Johnny cash song will be the background for this story of loss. A loosed arrow kills a rider. The character has blood on their hands, and knows their guilt. Virtues start messed up for this one. Goal is to live up to Momma's belief of who you are. Prove her right. You're not who they think you are.
Knife, Bow, Hide, Sneak

### The Sailor
When the yards broke off they said that I got killed, but I am living still. Gotta make my way back home and prove to my family that I am still around.
Navigate, Cartography, Sail, Swim

### The Lover
I rode into town and saw my love. She was being chased by another man. I charged him down and I took a stand. She ran to me and we tried to flee, but I only left with a what remains of the girl who will never be my bride. She was riddled with blood and I was left with a heartache I'll never leave behind.
Dance, Sing, Horseback, Pugilist

### The Crushed Rose
Yesterday the world was beautiful, but today everything is black.
You left to buy supplies for mamma in town, but now you're coming back.
You lost it all to three men, and have nothing to show
Except your torn clothes and bruises.
But what they did to you, the family can't ever know.
Mama would never smile again,
Papas face would never show.
Dance, Sing, Charm, Trade

### The Ugly Maid
The ugly duckling of the daughters, you always feel a little lame.
Vanilla wafer doesn't get you, rose makes you feel such shame.
You tend to stick with the animals, with the dogs and cats you play.
Tending to your papa's cows, and watching mama's chickens lay.
Tend Animal, Sing, Lute,  Perception

### The Oppressed
They told you not to do it.
Told you games to never play.
You whispered into darkness,
But your friend won't go away.
Nights have haunted you for weeks now,
But now its coming in the day.
Shadows surround you and something closing in to stay.
Sense Evil, Perception, Read, Hide

### Ms. Mary Sue Vanilla
Youngest of the daughters, nothing interesting has ever happened.
You've done nothing. Seen nothing. You just feel so plain.
Read, Sing, Tend Animals, Sneak

## Keys
Keys will open or close the door to new encounters.
A key might be as simple as timing. An encounter takes place for 1-10 hours. Miss it, and you missed out.
A key might be something from your past that has come back. You'll never see Justin become a soldier, if he never gets a sword. It's his only path into the service and you both know it.
Skills can be keys as well. If you can't swim or sail from the island, you can't see what's out in the ocean. If you don't have the perception to notice the handle, the door isn't even there. Can't read? The library is a mystery. Can't sing? Probably don't try changing the vibe at the public house.
Keys unlock doors and to walk through a door, you often need to find both.

### MVP Goal
Because Goodson and Ms. Mary Sue have the simplest intro, character creation will start with creating one of these two characters and beginning near the farm.
Exploring the nearby area and participating in the encounter Justin's Arming Sword.

## User Interface
### Virtues, Attributes, and Skills
These numbers will never be shown on the interface. Instead only an iconic representation or "weak reference" will serve as an indication of these values.

Virtues range from -100 to 100 with lower values representing less virtuous lifestyles and higher values representing more a virtuous past.
The values shown on the character sheet represent one's personal virtue, meaning these are the virtues as your character believes they stand. Note that even this score is not an accurate representation of the character's True virtue.
Values shown when a character examines an NPC in the world represent both how the character percieves that NPC (left icon) and how the NPC percieves the character (right icon).

Some ideas for representation of each virtue follow.
Neutral values (-25 to 25)  will be a grey man.

Charity
-75 Dark, cracked heart wreathed in red and orange flame that grows more fierce the lower the score. Begins to smoke at the lowest levels.
-25 Dark, cracked heart
+25  White heart
+75  White heart, blue aura, and golden light shining down. Grows more radiant at higher values.

Faith
-75 Dark void more and more dark tendrils reach from the void the lower the score. Begins to smoke at the lowest levels.
-25 Dark void
+25  White halo
+75  White halo, blue aura, and golden light shining down. Grows more radiant at higher values.

Humility
-75 A black dragon spewing flame and smoke
-25  A black dragon
+25 A lamb
+75 A lamb wreathed in a blue aura with a golden halo

Justice
-75 A black hyena devouring prey covered in blood
-25 A black hyena

For skills the values range from 0 - 100
As an example Navigation might display a compass on the skill tree if the character has a skill greater than 0.
Beside the compass or in a tooltip could be the words:
01  Novice
25 Amateur
50 Pilot
75 Helmsman
100 Navigator

Similarly for Sail the tooltips might be
01 Deckhand
25 Sailor
50 Mate

## A Few Encounter Ideas
### Justin's Arming Sword (key: Days 1-3)
Justin found an arming sword earlier this morning. He left it in the field, and went to find you and show you that he's going to be able to become a soldier. You both know he could never have afforded to purchase a sword like this and he wants to celebrate.

You find a sword in the field, or possibly on a goblin thief. Taking the sword for yourself you show it to Justin who looks on it with admiration. He can't admit he had found it first and you don't know.

Will you keep the weapon or give it to Justin? The only guide you may have is that it is his lifelong dream and that he could never afford such a blade.

Effects:
Determines if you or Justin become a soldier.
If Justin does he becomes a great hero and fulfills his life's dream. If you keep it, would you?

### Papas Bad Day (key: Animal Handling)
Something is wrong with Tully the bull. Papa tries to check on him. Tully panics and tramples papa. Can you calm the bull and save papa before its too late?

His life may depend on your quick action.

Effects:
Papa might live or die based on your actions. He's already injured and will spend time recovering either way.
You might be injured or killed yourself if you enter the pen, and Papa says no so you'll be in trouble if you don't listen... but Mama, mama would she ever forgive you if you didn't try to help?

### The Wrong Vial (key: Reading)
Farmer Perkins can't read but he's been sick lately. You notice as he's taking his medicine that the bottle reads Arsenic not Aresine. He doesn't know he might be killing himself.

Will you risk embarrassing the poor farmer in order to save a life?

Effects:
Farmer Perkins will die if he drinks the poison.
If you warn him, he'll be angry because he wasn't really going to drink it. Then he chases you off the farm for being such a mean child.
Mamma Perkins knows. She knows Farmer Perkins can't read and he's ashamed. She grows to love you. In time Farmer Perkins tells the story of how you bravely saved his life.

### Black Cat
A strange black cat keeps showing up on the farm. It's staring at you and wont leave. Something feels ominous about the creature, but you're not sure what to do.

Will you chase it away, follow it, or try and ignore it?

Effects:
It could be stalking you. It might be bringing something darker with it, or it may itself be a spy.
If you ignore it, then it may result in curses. If you harm it, they could be even worse.
Chasing it away may be the safest course of action. Reporting it to the constable could cause quite the investigation.

## Project Goals
### Imperfection
We don't want to strive for perfection.

We want beauty. Love. Honesty. Joy.

The game doesn't have to be perfect and nothing in the game has to be perfect. Make it beautiful, not sterile.

We want people to laugh and cry. Maybe even laugh at us at times. That's okay. We want to be honest.

Show the world we love them. That is the goal. Create something that tells someone somewhere, "God loves you."

Give someone hope.

Don't try to be perfect. Make a good story that inspires someone. Love, laugh, sing, smile.

### Special, Different, New
Don't chase topics that are worn old. Don't open old wounds.

The game should heal others.

It is not an action game. It is not a war game.

It is a series of stories that should touch the heart. Don't build Diablo. Battlefield. World of Warcraft.

Find the beauty inside Its a Wonderful Life, pluck it out and show George how valuable he really is. Don't let George kill himself. Show him the world without his actions.

### Jesus, Love, Mercy
Romans 12:19-21 KJV
[19] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. [20] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. [21] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

Psalm 99:5 KJV
[5] Exalt ye the LORD our God, And worship at his footstool; For he is holy.

Virtue should be impossible to win. Every action has the potential to crush each of the virtues, but few have a realistic expectation on increasing more than one.

Moment to moment gameplay, victory probably feels simple.
Looking back at what we have done it should feel hopelessly out of reach.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.

### Multiplayer? Coop?
Can we do it? Yes, maybe.
Should we? I don't know.
Would we like to? Yes, absolutely.

Ideally this will be a 1-4 player experience with shared storytelling. Each player will experience their own version of the story and their own encounters. Any players present for an encounter will all participate in that encounter. If the players split up and two discover `The Black Mine` and two discover `The Ghost Ship`, then only the players present will recieve rewards, face the trials, and experience the cinematic events that take place in their encounters.

It would have to unfold in a way where every story impacts each other. The players won't begin near each other, so they will slowly unfold different storylines. Everyone must have their own virtue scores, so that might be tough.

Needs a dedicated server if we do this.

Decision is up in the air, but for MVP it would be a distraction so tabled for now.

## Assets
### Synty primarily
These are pretty, but also simple.
Characters will be set based on background. Who you choose at the start never changes much. Maybe held items or possibly equipped bags or something?

Mostly any changes aren't visible though, because its not necessary for this game and will save time. No mesh swapping.

Icons will be simple SVG graphics. Most values will either be displayed at an Icon, Text, or combination. Not a lot of animation going on, beyond some glowing behind icons at extreme levels.

### So, are you the hero of the story?
Think for a moment of Saul.
He was winning. "I got you Stephen! Hah, noobs! We dit it!"
The encounters kept going his way. He looked great in the game. His stats were top notch.
"Hey Saul, new quest available. Here are orders, you've unlocked encounters across the region. Arrest them all."
On the cusp of victory Saul sets out for the capital. He is ready to win everything.
Charity: White heart blue background

Maybe he even thought as he set out for Demascus, "I'm such a good guy."

--- flashbang grenades

"Saul, Saul. Why are you persecuting me?"

Charity: Black, stoney heart wreathed in flames.

Saul thinks in horror, "Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
There is only one name who can deliver us from this body of death. 
Only one name can cleanse a coal black heart to pure white.
We need to point people toward the way.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.
