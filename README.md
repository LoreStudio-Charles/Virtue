# Virtue
Virtue is a game of heroic adventure, sacrifice, and loss.
To win, sometimes you must lose it all.

```
Stare into a mirror, what do you see? 
    Are you the man that you would wish you could be?
Others around you stare back and see, 
   only an image you've shown them to be.
Above it all and high on His throne, looks down loving father. 
   You are never alone.
```

## Virtues
Virtues are shown in the UI with animated icons that give a vague feeling of the character feels about the self or if examining someone else how they feel about the character. Only when the game ends is one's True virtue revealed.

We never see the numerical scores which range from -100 to 100.

### Charity
Pure love toward others is the virtue of charity. It can be expressed through giving, sacrifice, or sharing with others. Sometimes an action as simple as listening to another's troubles can demonstrate charity.
### Faith
Trust in God and in His promises as made through Christ and the Scriptures by which humans are justified or saved.
### Humility
The quality or condition of being humble; modest opinion or estimate of one's own importance, rank, etc. This virtue may be the most likely to deviate from True to Personal, as when one most thinks they are being humble is often when they are being the least humble.
### Justice
Rightfulness or lawfulness in an active state of defense against the schemes of evil doers. Often a virtue accompanied by violence of action.
### Perseverence
Continuance in a state of grace to the end, leading to eternal salvation.
### Temperance
Pureness and moderation in the indulgences of one's natural appetites or passions. Frequently related to abstinence from wanton lusts, gluttony, or drunkenness.
### Valor
Boldness or determination in facing great danger, especially in battle; heroic courage; bravery: Often associated with violence of action, but valor can also be tied to stillness in the face of danger. Standing patiently when everything within your soul screams that you should fight or run away.
### Worldwide (True Virtue)
Worldwide or true virtue is known only by the omniscient creator Loving Father. Not even the character would know these values for certain, but this is a measure of how the character's actions have shaped the world around themselves.
### Audience (Percieved Virtue)
Audience or percieved virtue is a character in the eyes of some other non-player character. This will affect how each individual within the world relates to the character and how they might treat or mistreat them.
### Personal (Internal Virtue)
Person or internal virtue is the virtue how the character views himself. Are they ashamed of their past? Proud of what they have done? Do they believe that they are inherently good? Are they really?

## Encounters
Virtues are tested by **encounters**. An encounter may seem trivial to the player, but even the most mundane encounter is a vital moment during which a character's virtues are exposed to the world around them. A player may see an encounter may be life or death, but in truth an encounter may be even more important. Even the most minor encounters may shape the character's ultimate fate.

During an encounter a character may face obstacles. Obstacles are the tests, trials, and tribulations which expose them to risk of loss and test their virtues. These often force players into situations where they must choose between their virtues or making a sacrifice or loss. 
### Obstacles
Obstacles represent the moment of hardship when a character must overcome some difficulty or face an especially difficult loss. Obstacles come in three varieties, Tests, Trials, and Tribulations. These are described below.

#### Tests
A test is something that a character must overcome to progress the story.

Tests most often require a character to use their skills to overcome some situation and are the kind of encounter testing that is least likely to negatively impact a characters virtue. Often the only implications of a test are to the character's Personal Virtues, although this is not always the case.

#### Trials
A trial is an event which will force a character to use a skill skill and also risk their virtues. 

Often trials require great sacrifice combined with skillful play in order to achieve the best results. 

There will often be shortcuts to make a Trial easier, but shortcuts may imperil the those around the character. They seem like the easy path, but may cause the greatest risk to harm of the character. The danger is that often a character may fail the test of some crucial virtue, and yet believe they have succeeded.
#### Tribulations
Tribulations are events which are meant to humble a character and present inevitable loss. You will suffer during a tribulation. 

Tribulations often ravage the character's Personal Virtues, but just as often the greatest opportunites to raise World and Audience virtues.

```
Ex: 

I have failed. I lost everything. Says the man who was robbed on the way to purchase goods.

No my son, you just don't see that your sacrfice has saved us all. 

The goods have been returned by authorities. 

I would only have lost my son if you had tried to stop them.
```

#### Attributes of an Encounter
#### Level
The expected level an encounter will take place. Often the level of an encounter is tied to the region in which it takes place, but this is not always the case.
#### Region/Location

#### Time and Triggers

### The Outlaw 
In forest deep, stands hunter tall,  
With strength of heart, a promise calls.  
His bowstring sings, and arrow flies  
the missile strays, and clears the skies.  

Beyond the stag a messenger falls,   
the guilt of blood, for justice calls.  
it stains my hands, I bear this cost,  
A heart so bold, now deeply lost.  

On the run, I flee my name,  
rumors spread, as does my shame.  
Oh, how I wish I could recall
That missiles flight, it's deadly fall.  

My mother's love, a beacon bright,  
Guides me home, through darkest night.  
I yearn to clear this bloody stain,  
hold momma close, and ease her pain.  

Alone I work to clear my name,  
and find my way back home again.  
The truth rise, it's imminent,  
And prove my soul is innocent.

### The Sailor
Upon the waves, I sail with pride,  
My family's love, I will abide.  
From distant lands, these goods I bring,  
Through stormy seas, their hearts still sing.  

Fate is cruel. It's rage resounds  
I washed into the Deepen Sounds  
My family fears that all is lost,  
Yet on this isle, I have been tossed.

With every breath, I must convey,  
I am alive; not swept away.  
Oh, whisper gently upon the breeze,  
let momma know I roam these seas.  

Though waters rise and tempest roars,  
In quiet moments, my spirit soars.  
I'll find my way back home in time,  
love knows no bounds, my hope sublime.
#### Starting Skills
Navigate, Cartography, Sail, Swim

### The Lover
I rode into town, my heart full of hope,  
To find my true love, with dreams we could cope.  
Yet shadows were cast, as danger drew near,  
A man chased her down, igniting my fear.  

I charged like the wind, with resolve in my veins,  
To defend my sweet love from the perilous chains.  
She ran to my side, with a spark in her eyes,  
But fate played its hand, and we faced our goodbyes.  

In the chaos, she faltered, a glint of despair,  
Her light flickered dim, in the cool evening air.  
With a last desperate gasp, our futures unfurled,  
I was left, broken-hearted, in a cruel, lonely world.  

Though I fought through the storm, for the girl in my dreams,  
I hold onto shadows, where love never gleams.  
She was lost to the night, leaving me in the fight,  
With the echo of heartache, my love lost from sight.  
#### Starting Skills
Dance, Sing, Horseback, Pugilist

### The Crushed Rose
In yesterday's embrace, the world was aglow,  
But today, a shadow drapes where light used to flow.  
You ventured to town, supplies for mama to find,  
Yet returned with a darkness that clings to your mind.  

Three men of the night stole more than just dreams,  
Leaving you with rags and bruises, silent screams.  
But the truth of that night, a secret you'll keep,  
For mama's smile shatters, and papa can't sleep.  

In the depths of your sorrow, their cruelty remains,  
A burden you carry, a weight of deep pains.  
For love binds and blinds, in the heartache it shows,  
A family's laughter, forever opposed.  
#### Starting Skills
Dance, Sing, Charm, Trade

### The Ugly Maid
In a world where beauty's grace is deemed the prize,  
The ugly duckling hides, beneath the watchful skies.  
Vanilla wafer seems pale, while rose brings you woe,  
With creatures as friends, your love truly grows.  

With playful pets, the dogs and cats, you find a joyful song,  
Among your father's gentle cows, where all the heartstrings throng.  
And as you watch your mother's hens, in tender sunlight sway,  
You cherish life's simple treasures, in a soft and honest way.  
#### Starting Skills
Tend Animal, Sing, Lute,  Perception

### The Oppressed
In whispers soft, they warned you clear,  
“Stay away from shadows, don't draw near.”  
Yet in the dark, you dared to play,  
And now your friend won't fade away.  

Haunted nights stretch long and deep,  
As waking visions pierce your sleep.  
Shadows linger, thick as day,  
With something close, it's here to stay.  

Fear wraps tight, a chilling shroud,  
As echoes rise from shadows loud.  
In the silence, whispers blend,  
A haunting tale that has no end.
#### Starting Skills
Sense Evil, Perception, Read, Hide

### Ms. Mary Sue Vanilla
In the shadow of sisters, the youngest stays,  
A whisper of longing in the quiet days.  
With dreams left unspoken, and tales yet untold,  
Life drifts like a breeze, serene and cold.  

In a world full of colors, she feels painted gray,  
An echo of silence where wishes decay.  
Nothing of grandeur, no spark to ignite,  
Just the quiet yearning for something that's bright.  

Yet in her stillness, a beauty may bloom,  
In the heart of the mundane, hope finds room.  
For even the plain can hold secrets so deep,  
In the silence of shadows, where secrets can keep.
#### Starting SKills
Read, Sing, Tend Animals, Sneak

## Keys
Keys will open or close the door to new encounters.
A key might be as simple as timing. An encounter takes place for 1-10 hours. Miss it, and you missed out.
A key might be something from your past that has come back. You'll never see Justin become a soldier, if he never gets a sword. It's his only path into the service and you both know it.
Skills can be keys as well. If you can't swim or sail from the island, you can't see what's out in the ocean. If you don't have the perception to notice the handle, the door isn't even there. Can't read? The library is a mystery. Can't sing? Probably don't try changing the vibe at the public house.
Keys unlock doors and to walk through a door, you often need to find both.

### MVP Goal
Because Goodson and Ms. Mary Sue have the simplest intro, character creation will start with creating one of these two characters and beginning near the farm.
Exploring the nearby area and participating in the encounter Justin's Arming Sword.

## User Interface
### Virtues, Attributes, and Skills
These numbers will never be shown on the interface. Instead only an iconic representation or "weak reference" will serve as an indication of these values.

Virtues range from -100 to 100 with lower values representing less virtuous lifestyles and higher values representing more a virtuous past.
The values shown on the character sheet represent one's personal virtue, meaning these are the virtues as your character believes they stand. Note that even this score is not an accurate representation of the character's True virtue.
Values shown when a character examines an NPC in the world represent both how the character percieves that NPC (left icon) and how the NPC percieves the character (right icon).

Some ideas for representation of each virtue follow.
Neutral values (-25 to 25)  will be a grey man.

## A Few Encounter Ideas
### Justin's Arming Sword (key: Days 1-3)
Justin found an arming sword earlier this morning. He left it in the field, and went to find you and show you that he's going to be able to become a soldier. You both know he could never have afforded to purchase a sword like this and he wants to celebrate.

You find a sword in the field, or possibly on a goblin thief. Taking the sword for yourself you show it to Justin who looks on it with admiration. He can't admit he had found it first and you don't know.

Will you keep the weapon or give it to Justin? The only guide you may have is that it is his lifelong dream and that he could never afford such a blade.

Effects:
Determines if you or Justin become a soldier.
If Justin does he becomes a great hero and fulfills his life's dream. If you keep it, would you?

### Papas Bad Day (key: Animal Handling)
Something is wrong with Tully the bull. Papa tries to check on him. Tully panics and tramples papa. Can you calm the bull and save papa before its too late?

His life may depend on your quick action.

Effects:
Papa might live or die based on your actions. He's already injured and will spend time recovering either way.
You might be injured or killed yourself if you enter the pen, and Papa says no so you'll be in trouble if you don't listen... but Mama, mama would she ever forgive you if you didn't try to help?

### The Wrong Vial (key: Reading)
Farmer Perkins can't read but he's been sick lately. You notice as he's taking his medicine that the bottle reads Arsenic not Aresine. He doesn't know he might be killing himself.

Will you risk embarrassing the poor farmer in order to save a life?

Effects:
Farmer Perkins will die if he drinks the poison.
If you warn him, he'll be angry because he wasn't really going to drink it. Then he chases you off the farm for being such a mean child.
Mamma Perkins knows. She knows Farmer Perkins can't read and he's ashamed. She grows to love you. In time Farmer Perkins tells the story of how you bravely saved his life.

### Black Cat
A strange black cat keeps showing up on the farm. It's staring at you and wont leave. Something feels ominous about the creature, but you're not sure what to do.

Will you chase it away, follow it, or try and ignore it?

Effects:
It could be stalking you. It might be bringing something darker with it, or it may itself be a spy.
If you ignore it, then it may result in curses. If you harm it, they could be even worse.
Chasing it away may be the safest course of action. Reporting it to the constable could cause quite the investigation.

## Project Goals
### Imperfection
We don't want to strive for perfection.

We want beauty. Love. Honesty. Joy.

The game doesn't have to be perfect and nothing in the game has to be perfect. Make it beautiful, not sterile.

We want people to laugh and cry. Maybe even laugh at us at times. That's okay. We want to be honest.

Show the world we love them. That is the goal. Create something that tells someone somewhere, "God loves you."

Give someone hope.

Don't try to be perfect. Make a good story that inspires someone. Love, laugh, sing, smile.

### Special, Different, New
Don't chase topics that are worn old. Don't open old wounds.

The game should heal others.

It is not an action game. It is not a war game.

It is a series of stories that should touch the heart. Don't build Diablo. Battlefield. World of Warcraft.

Find the beauty inside Its a Wonderful Life, pluck it out and show George how valuable he really is. Don't let George kill himself. Show him the world without his actions.

### Jesus, Love, Mercy
Romans 12:19-21 KJV
[19] Dearly beloved, avenge not yourselves, but rather give place unto wrath: for it is written, Vengeance is mine; I will repay, saith the Lord. [20] Therefore if thine enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink: for in so doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. [21] Be not overcome of evil, but overcome evil with good.

Psalm 99:5 KJV
[5] Exalt ye the LORD our God, And worship at his footstool; For he is holy.

Virtue should be impossible to win. Every action has the potential to crush each of the virtues, but few have a realistic expectation on increasing more than one.

Moment to moment gameplay, victory probably feels simple.
Looking back at what we have done it should feel hopelessly out of reach.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.

### Multiplayer? Coop?
Can we do it? Yes, maybe.
Should we? I don't know.
Would we like to? Yes, absolutely.

Ideally this will be a 1-4 player experience with shared storytelling. Each player will experience their own version of the story and their own encounters. Any players present for an encounter will all participate in that encounter. If the players split up and two discover `The Black Mine` and two discover `The Ghost Ship`, then only the players present will recieve rewards, face the trials, and experience the cinematic events that take place in their encounters.

It would have to unfold in a way where every story impacts each other. The players won't begin near each other, so they will slowly unfold different storylines. Everyone must have their own virtue scores, so that might be tough.

Needs a dedicated server if we do this.

Decision is up in the air, but for MVP it would be a distraction so tabled for now.

## Assets
### Synty primarily
These are pretty, but also simple.
Characters will be set based on background. Who you choose at the start never changes much. Maybe held items or possibly equipped bags or something?

Mostly any changes aren't visible though, because its not necessary for this game and will save time. No mesh swapping.

Icons will be simple SVG graphics. Most values will either be displayed at an Icon, Text, or combination. Not a lot of animation going on, beyond some glowing behind icons at extreme levels.

### So, are you the hero of the story?
Think for a moment of Saul.
He was winning. "I got you Stephen! Hah, noobs! We dit it!"
The encounters kept going his way. He looked great in the game. His stats were top notch.
"Hey Saul, new quest available. Here are orders, you've unlocked encounters across the region. Arrest them all."
On the cusp of victory Saul sets out for the capital. He is ready to win everything.
Charity: White heart blue background

Maybe he even thought as he set out for Demascus, "I'm such a good guy."

--- flashbang grenades

"Saul, Saul. Why are you persecuting me?"

Charity: Black, stoney heart wreathed in flames.

Saul thinks in horror, "Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
There is only one name who can deliver us from this body of death. 
Only one name can cleanse a coal black heart to pure white.
We need to point people toward the way.

What is a young hero to do?

Look for Mercy. Repent. Seek the Son. Love the Father.
